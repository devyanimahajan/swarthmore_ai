We will be trying to implement this with a robot, therefore our robot will need to be able to sense walls on its right side as well as walls in front. The robot has been given two RangeSensors on its right side, one close to the front and the other close to the rear.  The robot has also been given one RangeSensor centered on its front.  The robot has been given one LightSensor so that it can detect when the goal has been found."
